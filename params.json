However, what can be done to help them gain understanding of the data their existing apps create?\r\n\r\n\r\nIs a true \"digital democracy\" even possible with current mobile platforms? Unless users unlock the bootloaders on their Android devices to root them, they cannot access the internal SQLite databases that contain information about **them**. To this end, we have added an \"Export Database\" option that places a .sqlite database containing all the data collected by NervousNet in the \"Downloads\" folder of the device, where it can be viewed with third-party apps, or processed with external tools such as the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html)\r\n\r\n![SQLite Export](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kingsBSD/nervousnet-android/gh-pages/images/nervous_export.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### [MobileMiner](http://kingsbsd.github.io/MobileMiner/)\r\n\r\nOur previous project [Our Data Ourselves](https://big-social-data.net/) involved the creation of our [MobileMiner](http://kingsbsd.github.io/MobileMiner/) app, which was able to gather significant information about the activity of other apps. We have implemented three of the methods used as sensors with our version of NervousNet.\r\n \r\n1 Notifications\r\nBy prompting the user to enable the app as an \"[accessibility service](https://github.com/kingsBSD/nervousnet-android/blob/alt-master-kingsbsd/nervousnetrel_AndroidStudio/nervousnetrel/src/main/java/ch/ethz/soms/nervous/android/NotificationService.java)\" it is possible to log when internet-enabled apps send notifications to the user.\r\nWe have [shown](http://www.slideshare.net/kingsBSD/net-sci2015) that the number of notifications that Twitter sends a user is a reasonable indication of the numer of account they follow.\r\n\r\n2 Sockets\r\nIs is (sometimes) possible to determine which apps have opened network sockets by [polling](https://github.com/kingsBSD/nervousnet-android/blob/alt-master-kingsbsd/nervousnetrel_AndroidStudio/nervousnetrel/src/main/java/ch/ethz/soms/nervous/android/sensors/SocketSensor.java) the /proc/net/ directory for the PID of each app installed on the device. This method yields the protocol and port of the socket, it is interesting to see which apps use SSL on port 443. The various group permissions of the underlying Linux system means that this is not always possible, but browsers, media players and some games work well. MobileMiner acquires this data at a far higher frequency than is perhaps appropriate for NervousNet. \r\n\r\n3 Network Traffic\r\nWhen socket usage can't be determined for an app, the Android traffic statistics API *might* work. -The documentation doesn't explain why this information is sometimes withheld for some apps. Again, by [polling](https://github.com/kingsBSD/nervousnet-android/blob/alt-master-kingsbsd/nervousnetrel_AndroidStudio/nervousnetrel/src/main/java/ch/ethz/soms/nervous/android/sensors/SensorDescTraffic.java) this API, we can track the network behavious of many apps.",
