However, what can be done to help them gain understanding of the data their existing apps create?\r\n\r\n\r\nIs a true \"digital democracy\" even possible with current mobile platforms? Unless users unlock the bootloaders on their Android devices to root them, they cannot access the internal SQLite databases that contain information about **them**. To this end, we have added an \"Export Database\" option that places a .sqlite database containing all the data collected by NervousNet in the \"Downloads\" folder of the device, where it can be viewed with third-party apps, or processed with external tools such as the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html)\r\n\r\n![SQLite Export](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kingsBSD/nervousnet-android/gh-pages/images/nervous_export.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### [MobileMiner](http://kingsbsd.github.io/MobileMiner/)\r\n\r\nOur previous project [Our Data Ourselves](https://big-social-data.net/) involved the creation of our [MobileMiner](http://kingsbsd.github.io/MobileMiner/) app, which was able to gather significant information about the activity of other apps.\r\n",
